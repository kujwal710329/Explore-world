put all the express configuration in app.js file

app.js file is mainly used for middleware declaration.app.js is the main app of our project which contains small projects like tour app and user app

JSON.parse() converts the json string into the array of javascript object.

remember that when we exports data from a file using exports objects, and when import everything into one object, then all of the data that was on exports , now gonna be on tourController. and we can use tourController.getAllTours and such

process.env gives the  object of all the environment variables defined in the node app.

in the .eslintrc.json file set the end of line auto to avoid error in the whole project.

// This is just a param middleware to check whether the entered id is valid or not.

req.query is used to find the query coming from the query string.

we can not use virtual property in querying to the db like Tour.find().where(durationWeeks).equals(1) cant be used.

query middleware allows us to run functions before or after a certain query is executed.
